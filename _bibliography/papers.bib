  abstract = {Many data sets can be viewed as a noisy sampling of an underlying space, and tools from topological data analysis can characterize this structure for the purpose of knowledge discovery. One such tool is persistent homology, which provides a multiscale description of the homological features within a data set. A useful representation of this homological information is a persistence diagram (PD). Efforts have been made to map PDs into spaces with additional structure valuable to machine learning tasks. We convert a PD to a finite- dimensional vector representation which we call a persistence image (PI), and prove the stability of this transformation with respect to small perturbations in the inputs. The discriminatory power of PIs is compared against existing methods, showing significant performance gains. We explore the use of PIs with vector-based machine learning tools, such as linear sparse support vector machines, which identify features containing discriminating topological information. Finally, high accuracy inference of parameter values from the dynamic output of a discrete dynamical system (the linked twist map) and a partial differential equation (the anisotropic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation) provide a novel application of the discriminatory power of PIs.},

  abstract = {Motivated by hexagonal patterns with defects in natural and laboratory systems, we compare quantitative measures of order for nearly hexagonal, planar lattices. These include a spectral measure of order based on the Fourier transform, a geometric measure of order using the Delaunay triangulation, and topological measures of order introduced in this paper. The topological measures are based on a tool from topological data analysis called persistent homology. We contrast these measures of order by comparing their sensitivity to perturbations of Bravais lattices. We then study the imperfect hexagonal arrangements of nanodots produced by numerical simulations of partial differential equations that model the surface of a binary alloy undergoing erosion by a broad ion beam. These numerical experiments further distinguish the various measures of hexagonal order and highlight the role of various model parameters in the formation and elimination of defects. Finally, we quantify the dependence of order on prepatterning the surface to suggest experimental protocols that could lead to improved order in nanodot arrays.},

  abstract="We use persistent homology in order to define a family of fractal dimensions, denoted dimPHi($\mu$){\$}{\$}{\backslash}dim {\_}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}PH{\}}{\}}^i({\backslash}mu ){\$}{\$}for each homological dimension i{\thinspace}≥{\thinspace}0, assigned to a probability measure $\mu$ on a metric space. The case of zero-dimensional homology (i{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0) relates to work by Steele (Ann Probab 16(4): 1767--1787, 1988) studying the total length of a minimal spanning tree on a random sampling of points. Indeed, if $\mu$ is supported on a compact subset of Euclidean space ℝm{\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}R{\}}^m{\$}{\$}for m{\thinspace}≥{\thinspace}2, then Steele's work implies that dimPH0($\mu$)=m{\$}{\$}{\backslash}dim {\_}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}PH{\}}{\}}^0({\backslash}mu )=m{\$}{\$}if the absolutely continuous part of $\mu$ has positive mass, and otherwise dimPH0($\mu$)<m{\$}{\$}{\backslash}dim {\_}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm {\{}PH{\}}{\}}^0({\backslash}mu )<m{\$}{\$}. Experiments suggest that similar results may be true for higher-dimensional homology 0{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}i{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}m, though this is an open question. Our fractal dimension is defined by considering a limit, as the number of points n goes to infinity, of the total sum of the i-dimensional persistent homology interval lengths for n random points selected from $\mu$ in an i.i.d. fashion. To some measures $\mu$, we are able to assign a finer invariant, a curve measuring the limiting distribution of persistent homology interval lengths as the number of points goes to infinity. We prove this limiting curve exists in the case of zero-dimensional homology when $\mu$ is the uniform distribution over the unit interval, and conjecture that it exists when $\mu$ is the rescaled probability measure for a compact set in Euclidean space with positive Lebesgue measure.",

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
