  abstract = {Many data sets can be viewed as a noisy sampling of an underlying space, and tools from topological data analysis can characterize this structure for the purpose of knowledge discovery. One such tool is persistent homology, which provides a multiscale description of the homological features within a data set. A useful representation of this homological information is a persistence diagram (PD). Efforts have been made to map PDs into spaces with additional structure valuable to machine learning tasks. We convert a PD to a finite- dimensional vector representation which we call a persistence image (PI), and prove the stability of this transformation with respect to small perturbations in the inputs. The discriminatory power of PIs is compared against existing methods, showing significant performance gains. We explore the use of PIs with vector-based machine learning tools, such as linear sparse support vector machines, which identify features containing discriminating topological information. Finally, high accuracy inference of parameter values from the dynamic output of a discrete dynamical system (the linked twist map) and a partial differential equation (the anisotropic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation) provide a novel application of the discriminatory power of PIs.},

  abstract = {Motivated by hexagonal patterns with defects in natural and laboratory systems, we compare quantitative measures of order for nearly hexagonal, planar lattices. These include a spectral measure of order based on the Fourier transform, a geometric measure of order using the Delaunay triangulation, and topological measures of order introduced in this paper. The topological measures are based on a tool from topological data analysis called persistent homology. We contrast these measures of order by comparing their sensitivity to perturbations of Bravais lattices. We then study the imperfect hexagonal arrangements of nanodots produced by numerical simulations of partial differential equations that model the surface of a binary alloy undergoing erosion by a broad ion beam. These numerical experiments further distinguish the various measures of hexagonal order and highlight the role of various model parameters in the formation and elimination of defects. Finally, we quantify the dependence of order on prepatterning the surface to suggest experimental protocols that could lead to improved order in nanodot arrays.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
